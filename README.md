# Trends and Challenges in Toronto’s Homeless Population (2018-2024):Focus on Demographics and Chronic Homelessness

## Overview

This paper explores Toronto’s homeless population from 2018 to 2024, focusing on age, gender, and chronic homelessness trends. The data reveal a decline during the pandemic, followed by a rebound, with males and individuals aged 35-44 making up the majority. The number of chronically homeless also increased significantly. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions to address chronic homelessness and improve housing policies.
